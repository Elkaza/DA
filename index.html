        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <p>The current job market indicates that there are many methods and frameworks used by various companies in different teams. However, the visibility of the use of a template or any framework to ensure coherence between all the different teams with their various methods and frameworks is not apparent. Therefore, this survey aims to investigate the current state of practice in Change and Transformation Management in Austria, with a focus on Coherence Governance During Organizational Transformation.</p>

            <h3>Univ.Lektorin Mag.a Jutta Jerlich</h3>
            <p>Role: Supervisor</p>
            <p>With a quarter century of experience in Product / Business Development and Innovation working with leading experts and companies in an international arena, I have always been a translator of strategic requirements and market realities into product and service features by using the right technology to build ecosystem business models.</p>
            <p>In the course of developing technology education and programs my passion lies in using technology as a lever for positive change and societal impact. I initiated countless projects and collaborated with organisations and experts from different backgrounds, cultures and countries in diverse roles in innovation, communication, strategy and program management. Mentoring is always part of my role as University Educator for Creativity und Leadership. Having spent several years abroad, among the countries Japan, the USA and India have paved my way in so many aspects.</p>
            <p>No theory can prepare you for reality. That is why my programs are an experience. I believe that humans are made to collaborate and co-create. As an engineer never works alone, bringing the skill to bring diverse parties together in order to jointly produce a mutually valued outcome is crucial for success. Integrating self-reflection and feedback from peers into team work processes needs to become a routine enabling everyone to bring their best to the equation. My courses give participants the opportunity to put their ideas on the workbench and develop them collaboratively.</p>
