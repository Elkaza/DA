        <section id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The introduction and research questions you've drafted are quite good, but there are a few tweaks and corrections that could enhance the clarity and 
            flow. Here’s a revised version: In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations, especially those in the IT sector, face a myriad of 
            challenges. Adapting to innovations such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data is crucial. Historical examples of industry 
            adaptation failures, like Nokia's in 2010, underscore the necessity of skillful change and transformation management. Companies are constantly adopting
            new management methods, yet often they fail to achieve their broader goals, indicating uncertainty in their current approaches. This research aims to
             map the current methodological landscape with a focus on coherence.</p></section>
