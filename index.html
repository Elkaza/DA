            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Change and transformation in enterprises are a major way to overcome the rapidly changing environment in business but over time different approaches emerge to the surface with their methods and frameworks bringing different tools and sub tools all can be observed in many enterprises depending on the sizes and the organizational structure, for instance, some have a parent company and subsidiaries all of which have their freedom somehow on how to accomplish tasks and deliver services as the preference is varying depending on the people preferences. Continuous problems require continuous solutions, but when the problem is divided into smaller problems with smaller solutions, there is a need to make sure all of these solutions are working together somehow. The objective of this thesis is to look into the Methodological Landscape in general and then into the Austrian industry. To explore the general methodological landscape and, for scoping purposes, “specifically focuses on the Austrian methodological landscape to collect more controlled and concise data, thereby capturing the methodological landscape in Austria, and how this landscape looks, and what is the status of coherence within the Landscape? Investigating the challenges of the combination of different methodological approaches with a focused analysis on coherence and presenting a framework to improve the coherence situation during organizational change. The importance of coherence during the transformation and change process and how it could benefit both the process and stakeholders. The harmony of the transformation and change process is as important as the ingredients of the process recipe. Success, or even surpassing it, is what every strategy aims for, but taking advantage of opportunities and ensuring benefits from them across the enterprise when possible is crucial. The effectiveness of the transformation and change process is a significant factor in determining outcomes. Embracing innovation is common nowadays in aspiring organizations, but one of the key success factors for innovation management is constant improvement and resource allocation. Here comes the importance of coherence and harmony, which are beneficial beyond mere transformation and change management. The methodological landscape of enterprise transformation, especially in the context of continuous rapid development and the challenges it introduces, is not well understood. This includes how it impacts the process and its multiple stakeholders, each with different needs and requirements. To clarify this landscape, exploring the various types available, understanding the differences among them, and examining how each difference offers unique benefits, will be essential. Bringing snapshots of these landscapes into view can be instrumental in grasping the bigger picture.</p>

        <section id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations, especially those in the IT sector, face a myriad of 
            challenges. Adapting to innovations such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data is crucial. Historical examples of industry 
            adaptation failures, like Nokia's in 2010, underscore the necessity of skillful change and transformation management. Companies are constantly adopting
            new management methods, yet often they fail to achieve their broader goals, indicating uncertainty in their current approaches. This research aims to
             map the current methodological landscape with a focus on coherence.</p></section>
