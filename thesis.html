            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The objective of this thesis is to explore the general Methodological Landscape, with a specific focus on the Austrian industry. This research aims to collect controlled and concise data, capturing the landscape in Austria, examining its characteristics, and assessing the status of coherence within it.</p>
            <p>To complement this study, data from job postings in the Austrian IT sector will be analyzed to identify the methods and frameworks mentioned in job descriptions. This analysis will help draw the current methodological landscape and will be supplemented with a survey targeted at companies based on the analysis. The findings will then be used to propose a framework designed to enhance coherence during organizational changes.</p>
            <p>The importance of coherence throughout the transformation and change process is highlighted, demonstrating how it can benefit both the process itself and its stakeholders. The harmony of the transformation and change process is as crucial as the ingredients in the recipe of the process.</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, organizations, especially those in the IT sector, face a myriad of challenges. Adapting to innovations such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data is crucial. Historical examples of industry adaptation failures, like Nokia's in 2010, underscore the necessity of skillful change and transformation management. Companies are constantly adopting new management methods, yet often they fail to achieve their broader goals, indicating uncertainty in their current approaches. This research aims to map the current methodological landscape with a focus on coherence.</p>

            <h2>Research Steps:</h2>
            <section id="Problem statement">
                <h3>1. Problem statement</h3>
                <p>Change and transformation in enterprises are a major way to overcome the rapidly changing environment in business but over time different approaches emerge to the surface with their methods and frameworks bringing different tools and sub tools all can be observed in many enterprises depending on the sizes and the organizational structure, for instance, some have a parent company and subsidiaries all of which have their freedom somehow on how to accomplish tasks and deliver services as the preference is varying depending on the people preferences.</p>
                <p>Continuous problems require continuous solutions, but when the problem is divided into smaller problems with smaller solutions, there is a need to make sure all of these solutions are working together somehow.</p>

                <li>How does the methodological landscape of enterprise transformation appear within the Austrian industry?</li>
                <li>What are the various disciplines involved in enterprise change management, and how do they intersect and overlap?</li>
                <li>How can these disciplines be cohesively managed to support enterprise transformation?</li>
